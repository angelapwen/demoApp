## Notes

I did not encounter significant challenges while building the basic functionality of the app. I spent some time learning Swift and the Xcode environment before beginning. The most time-consuming part was learning the different views and perspectives on Xcode as well as familiarizing myself with its features such as control-drag. 

I am planning to implement several of the optional features in order to learn more about Xcode, Swift, and the iOS framework.
